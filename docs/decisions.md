# Decisions

The significant, durable choices behind GitTide and the alternatives they
rejected — the *why* that the spec sections reference but don't belabour. Append a
new entry when a choice is hard to reverse, surprising, or rejects a real
alternative; link to it from the relevant spec. Don't rewrite history — supersede
an entry with a newer one if it changes.

## Product

- **D1 — Project-first model.** A Project groups multiple repositories; this is the
  product's differentiator over one-repo-at-a-time clients. *Why:* fast multi-repo
  context switching. → [`product`](spec/product/product.md)
- **D2 — MVP excludes network ops beyond clone.** No push/pull/fetch, no branch
  management in the first cut. *Why:* focus the MVP; those land post-MVP with the
  network feature set. → [`product`](spec/product/product.md)
- **D3 — Multi-window, hybrid.** Windows are views over shared services; "active
  project" is **per-window** state, not a global. *Why:* open several projects at
  once without a global mode. → [`product`](spec/product/product.md)
- **D4 — Submodules discovered live, never persisted.** Git state is the single
  source of truth; opening a submodule reuses the normal repo machinery. *Why:* no
  stale list when `.gitmodules` changes. → [`product`](spec/product/product.md)
- **D21 — Branch checkout is stash-and-switch (safe by default).** On a dirty
  working tree, checkout stashes, switches, then re-applies the stash onto the
  target so the work follows the user; a re-apply conflict stops and keeps the
  stash. *Rejected:* clean-tree-only (blocks the most common case), block-with-
  message (same), and stash-then-leave-it-parked (no stash-list UI yet → work gets
  forgotten). Uses git stash **internally** only — not the user-facing stash wish.
  → [`product`](spec/product/product.md), [`engineering`](spec/engineering/engineering.md)
- **D5 — Two persistence files.** `projects.json` (registry) is separate from
  `session.json` (window state). *Why:* opening/moving windows never rewrites the
  project registry. → [`product`](spec/product/product.md)

## Engineering

- **D6 — C++23 + Qt 6 Widgets (not QML).** Native desktop; the graph uses
  `QGraphicsView`. → [`engineering`](spec/engineering/engineering.md)
- **D7 — Strict layering; `core/` is pure C++, no Qt.** *Why:* the git engine stays
  unit-testable and the boundaries stay honest. → [`engineering`](spec/engineering/engineering.md)
- **D8 — libgit2 & nlohmann/json are PRIVATE to `core/`.** *Why:* no dependency
  leaks onto downstream consumers. → [`engineering`](spec/engineering/engineering.md)
- **D9 — Errors are values (`std::expected`), no exceptions across layers** — and
  none thrown from Qt slots. *Why:* predictable control flow; throwing from a slot
  is undefined behaviour. → [`engineering`](spec/engineering/engineering.md)
- **D10 — Concurrency = QtConcurrent + QCoro.** *Rejected:* `std::execution
  par_unseq` (drags in TBB on libstdc++) and a hand-rolled thread pool (reinvents
  QtConcurrent). *Why:* QtConcurrent ships with Qt; QCoro adds `co_await` with a
  small dep. → [`engineering`](spec/engineering/engineering.md)
- **D11 — Partial-staging patch synthesis lives in Core, not UI.** *Why:* keeps it
  Qt-free and Catch2-testable. → [`engineering`](spec/engineering/engineering.md)
- **D12 — Qt via `find_package` (system/aqtinstall), never FetchContent;
  libgit2/QCoro/Catch2 via FetchContent; vcpkg avoided.** *Why:* building Qt from
  source is impractical; pinned FetchContent tags are reproducible. →
  [`engineering`](spec/engineering/engineering.md)
- **D13 — Network transports off this milestone (`USE_SSH`/`USE_HTTPS` OFF).**
  *Why:* avoids the OpenSSL/mbedTLS dependency; local and `file://` paths suffice
  for now. → [`engineering`](spec/engineering/engineering.md)
- **D14 — Paths via `generic_u8string()`, never `.string()`.** *Why:* `.string()`
  yields ANSI on Windows and corrupts non-ASCII names. → [`engineering`](spec/engineering/engineering.md)
- **D15 — Classic `#include` headers, not C++ modules.** *Why:* Qt's `moc` does not
  cooperate with module units. (The original design intended modules in Core; the
  reality is headers.) → [`engineering`](spec/engineering/engineering.md)
- **D16 — Coding standard = Workswell, adopted verbatim** (`m_` members, lowercase
  file names, Allman braces). Existing code is conformed **when touched**, not in a
  repo-wide reformat. *Why:* a shared standard, with opportunistic migration to
  avoid big-bang churn. → [`code-style`](spec/engineering/code-style.md)

## Design

- **D17 — One accent (cyan brand); never a second hue** for emphasis. *Why:* brand
  coherence. → [`design`](spec/design/design.md)
- **D18 — Colour comes only from tokens; both themes define every token.** *Why:*
  adding a theme is adding one column, and no widget hard-codes a hex. →
  [`design`](spec/design/design.md)
- **D19 — Never signal state by colour alone** — always pair with an icon/letter.
  *Why:* accessibility. → [`design`](spec/design/design.md)

## Process

- **D20 — A living spec, not append-only dated specs.** Design lands in a
  domain-organised spec that stays current (`wishlist → spec → plans`); symbol-level
  docs live in Doxygen comments, cross-cutting design in the spec, and the **code is
  ground truth** when the two drift. *Why:* one always-current source of truth
  instead of reassembling intent from a pile of dated plans. →
  [`spec.md`](spec/spec.md), [`workflow.md`](workflow.md)
